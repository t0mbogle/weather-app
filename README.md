## Project status
Not recieving updates currently. If given more time to work on the project I would add more CSS styling and events 
when clicking on a specific days forecast. A toggle could be added to change the temperatures between celsius and fahrenheit 
as well as a bakcground colour change depending on the time of day. Stay tuned :)
