# Weather App
This is a front-end project ulitising React to display the weather for the next 5 days.
A user can search any city in the UK to show the forecast for that location. 

### Available Scripts
`npm test` will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode (Jest/RTL).
After forking and cloning the repo, running `npm start` will open the app on your localhost:3000 so the project can be viewed in your browser. The project has been deployed on github pages, also see the Environments section to view it!

## Concepts Covered & Softwares Used
- React (Hooks, Stateful components, Event handling)
- JSX
- Prop validation (Prop-Types)
- Test Driven Development (Jest, React Testing Library)
- External data (heroku weather app API, axios)
- UI design (CSS)

## Acknowledgements
This is a project from the Software Engineering course by Manchester Codes.

## Project status
Not receiving updates currently. If given more time to work on the project I would add more CSS styling and events 
when clicking on a specific days forecast. A toggle could be added to change the temperatures between celsius and fahrenheit 
as well as a background colour change depending on the time of day. Stay tuned :)
